## Product Overview

### What is ZeitPal?

ZeitPal is a modern, open-source, GDPR-compliant absence and leave management SaaS platform built specifically for European companies, with a primary focus on the German market. It replaces Excel spreadsheets and email chaos with an intuitive, automated system for managing employee time off.

### Core Problem Solved

Before ZeitPal, many companies manage employee absences through:
- Excel spreadsheets prone to errors and version conflicts
- Email chains that get lost or forgotten
- Manual calculations of remaining leave days
- No visibility into team availability
- Non-compliance with labor laws

ZeitPal solves all these problems with a centralized, automated, compliant solution.

### Key Differentiators

1. **German Market Focus**: Built with German labor law (BUrlG) compliance in mind, including automatic public holiday calculations for all 16 federal states
2. **Generous Free Tier**: Free forever for teams up to 20 employees - no credit card required
3. **Privacy First**: GDPR compliant with data exclusively hosted in Germany/EU
4. **Speed**: Setup in under 15 minutes, no training required
5. **Open Source**: MIT licensed, transparent, community-driven
