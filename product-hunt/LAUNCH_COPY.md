## First Comment (Post this immediately after launching)

Hey Product Hunt!

I'm excited to launch ZeitPal - the leave management tool I wish existed when I was running a small team in Germany.

**The Problem:**
Managing team absences with Excel spreadsheets is a nightmare. Enterprise HR software costs €10+ per user and is overkill for small teams. We needed something in between.

**The Solution:**
ZeitPal is 100% free for teams up to 20 employees. Here's what makes it different:

**Core Features:**
- One-click leave requests & approvals
- Visual team calendar showing who's out
- Automatic leave balance calculations
- Sick leave tracking with AU reminders
- Email & Slack notifications

**Built for Europe:**
- 100% GDPR compliant
- German labor law support (16 Bundesländer with correct holidays!)
- Hosted on European servers
- Available in German and English

**Why Free?**
Small teams shouldn't pay enterprise prices. ZeitPal is free forever for teams under 20. We only charge for advanced features like SSO, API access, and custom integrations.

**Tech Stack** (for the curious):
- Next.js 15 with React 19
- Cloudflare Pages & D1
- Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS 4

Would love your feedback! What features would make this perfect for your team?

## Maker Story

As a founder running a small startup in Germany, I spent countless hours managing vacation requests via email and tracking sick days in spreadsheets. The HR tools on the market were either:

1. **Too expensive** - €10-15 per user for features we didn't need
2. **Not GDPR compliant** - Built for US companies with data stored abroad
3. **Missing German features** - No support for state-specific holidays or labor laws

So I built ZeitPal. It's the tool I always wanted: simple, beautiful, and actually understands European workplace requirements.
